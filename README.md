# DevOps Dashboard - Built with Airplane


## TO-DO
===

  - Create task for actually spinning up servers
  	+ Make sure all Airplane-created servers are tagged
  - Create task for deleting servers
  - Make sure view task only displays Airplane-tagged servers
  - Create View that runs the view task and shows the table at all times
  - Create button in View to destroy a server
  - Create button in View to create a new server
  - Take input for server name, etc in the View
  - Should we try to work in prompts somehow to show that spinning up resources can be limited?
